**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Ethics is indeed a concern with this database as it contains private customer information. First and last customer names and partial postal codes could have been collected without the customer's consent. Second, this private data can potentially introduce bias to the analysis, if a person analyzing is related to the customers in some way. Third, these private data reflect a pretty long purchase history ( about 1.5 years long), which if leaked to a third party, can be used to assess buying behaviours. We as trainees haven't signed any agreement for the database use so the data can leak and be used improperly.

To avoid the issues mentioned above, the customer data could have been anonymized. There also could have been some agreement between the customers and the database creators/users on when the database should be destroyed, how it's being used, and what is the level of authorization to access the data.

There could be issues with labour rights for the data entry but further information is needed.
